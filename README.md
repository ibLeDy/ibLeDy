My name is Iago Alonso and I'm a self-taught developer and computer technician.
I also taught myself about music production and video editing (motion graphics and video production/postproduction). I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks, although Iâ€™m mainly focused on backend.

I began my journey as a software developer using Python as my main language, as it looked like the most complete tool that would allow me to aquire the biggest amount of knowledge with the least syntactic barrier.
