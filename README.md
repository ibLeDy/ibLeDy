I'm a self-taught developer and computer technician. I started with Python as my main
programming language because i saw it as the most complete tool that enabled learning
with the least syntactic barrier.

I love computers and technology. Configuring each program to the maximum, knowing how
they work and how to modify, repair and configure almost every part of a modern PC is
what floats my boat.
